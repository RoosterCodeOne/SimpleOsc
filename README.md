# SimpleOsc

A custom audio plugin built with JUCE.  
Itâ€™s designed as a minimalist oscillator for sound exploration, healing, and musical creativity.

### ðŸ”§ Features
- Free mode + Snap-to-frequency modes
- Modifier slots (Binaural, Breath LFO, Harmonics, Atmosphere)
- Built using JUCE and C++

### ðŸ“¦ Status
Still in development â€” modifiers and UI are evolving rapidly.

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists
I'm building this plugin to learn more about:
- Audio plugin development
- JUCE and C++
- Structuring real-world DSP projects
- Creating tools for sound healing and experimental music

### ðŸ§  Goals
- Build a usable standalone app or VST/AU plugin
- Grow this into part of a larger audio playground (Sound Mind)
